# Soccer Events Detection


In the world of sports analytics, the ability to automatically detect and identify events within a soccer match holds immense potential for enhancing coaching strategies and player performance evaluation. 
This project aims to develop a system to identify soccer and non soccer events and classify relevant soc- cer events from images, extract from match footages. 
Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image processing algorithms, the system analyzes video frames to recognize various events such as penalties, tackles, corner kicks, cards and more. 
The study also compares two different CNN and their relative performances, evaluating the capabilities and the struggles of each one
